# What I did
What I did was to create a static array to TCB structs which contain thread
info. Each time a new thread is created, the thread's id is used to index into
this array and allocate a new stack, set registers, etc. I keep track of the
number of living threads, including main, and when pthread_exit is called if
there is only 1 remaining thread my program calls exit(0). My signal handler
just saves the current thread's state, finds a ready thread to schedule, sets a
single 50000ns alarm and then longjmp is used to jump to the thread's execution.

# Issues
I had no problems. My program passed all the basic tests and my own tests.
